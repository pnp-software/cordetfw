1|Identify Target Application|Identify the application for which the framework is being instantiated. ||The Application Identifier is specified in \texttt{CrFwUserConstants.h}.
2|Identify Service Users |Identify the users of the services provided by the target application. Each service user is identified through its Application Identifier.  ||The service user identifiers are used to define the sources of incoming commands (InCommands) for the application in \texttt{CrFwInStreamUserPar.h} and the destination of out-going reports (OutCompnents) in \texttt{CrFwOutStreamUserPar.h}.
3|Identify Service Providers |Identify the providers of the services used by the target application. Each service provider is identified through its Application Identifier. ||The service provider identifiers are used to define the sources of incoming reports (InReports) for the application in \texttt{CrFwInStreamUserPar.h} and the destination of out-going commands (OutCompnents) in \texttt{CrFwOutStreamUserPar.h}.
4|Define Used Services |Define the services which are used by the target application. Each service is defined through: its identifier (the "service type"); a description of the purpose of the service; the external entity which provides the service; the commands and reports which implement the service. ||The range of services used by the application is defined in \texttt{CrFwInFactoryUserPar.h} and \texttt{CrFwOutFactoryUserPar.h}. Also, a list of services supported by the application is defined in \texttt{CrFwOutRegistryUserPar.h}.
5|Define Provided Services |Define the services which are provided by the target application. Each service is defined through: its identifier (the "service type"); a description of the purpose of the service; the external entity which uses the service; the commands and reports which implement the service.  ||The range of services provided by the application is defined in \texttt{CrFwInFactoryUserPar.h} and \texttt{CrFwOutFactoryUserPar.h}.

11|Define Command and Report Layout|For each command and report which can be either generated or received by the target application, define the layout of the packet which carries it.|\ref{sec:PcktImpl}|The packet layout is implicitly implemented in the setter and getter functions of the \texttt{CrFwPckt.h} interface. The application developer must provide a complete implementation for this interface. A stub implementation is provided in the configuration directory \texttt{/cr/src/crConfigTestSuite}.
12|Define Packet Allocation Policy|Define the allocation policy for the packets which the application creates when it receives a command or report.|\ref{sec:PcktImpl}|The packet allocation policy is implemented in the \texttt{make} function of the \texttt{CrFwPckt.h} interface.

14|Define Application Modes|Define the sub-states in the states of the Application State Machine.|\ref{sec:AppStartUp}|For each set of sub-states, a state machine implementing them is defined which is then embedded in one of the states of the Application State Machine. The embedded state machines are defined in \texttt{CrFwAppSmUserApp.h}. 
15|Define Incoming Middleware Interface|Define the interface to the middleware which is responsible for receiving the commands and reports for the target application.|\ref{sec:InStream}|For each source of commands or reports, one InStream is defined.
