BAS|S|1|All components provided by the CORDET Framework shall implement the behaviour of the Base State Machine of figure \ref{fig:BaseSM}.|The behaviour of the Base State Machine is implemented in \texttt{CrFwBaseCmp}. Each framework component is built around a state machine instance which is derived from the Base State Machine (see section 5 of reference [CR-UM]). State machine derivation is done using the extension mechanism of the C1 Implementation of the FW Profile  which guarantees that the derived state machines have the same behaviour as the base state machine. Framework component are instantiated by Make functions (see section 6.1 of reference [CR-UM]). The creation of their state machine as an extension of the Base State Machine is done in these Make functions.|The behaviour of the Base State Machine is verified in table \ref{tab:verBaseSM}. The behaviour of its two procedures (Initialization Procedure and Reset Procedure) is verified in table \ref{tab:verInitProc} and \ref{tab:verResetProc}). The inheritance of this behaviour by all other framework state machines is guaranteed by the extension mechanism of the FW Profile as it is implemented in the C1 Implementation and by the fact that all framework components are created as extension of a Base State Machine.
BAS|S|2|The CORDET Framework shall implement an API through which applications can query a CORDET Component for its current state (including, if applicable, its current sub-state).|Only two levels of state machine embedding are used in the C2 Implementation.

Embedded states are only embedded in state CONFIGURED and query of this embedded state is provided by functions with names like \texttt{CrFw$\langle$Type$\rangle$IsIn$\langle$State$\rangle$($\langle$Inst$\rangle$)}.|The state query functions are guaranteed to be verified because the Test Suite has 100\% statement coverage.
