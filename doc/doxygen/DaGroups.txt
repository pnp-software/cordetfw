/** @defgroup crDemo Demo Application 
 * 
 * @brief Demo application for the CORDET Framework
 *
 * The CORDET Demo consists of three applications: the Master Application,
 * the Slave 1 Application and the Slave 2 Application.
 * The two slave applications are responsible for monitoring a temperature sensor.
 * If they find a limit violation, they send a report to the Master Application.
 * The Master Application is responsible for enabling and disabling the
 * monitoring in the slave applications and for setting the monitoring limits.
 *
 * The CORDET Demo supports one single service: the "Temperature Monitoring
 * Service".
 * The type identifier of the Temperature Monitoring Service is equal to: 64.
 * This service is implemented by the following commands and reports:
 * - Sub-Type 1: Command to enable temperature monitoring
 * - Sub-Type 2: Command to disable temperature monitoring
 * - Sub-Type 3: Command to set the temperature limit
 * - Sub-Type 4: Report to report a temperature limit violation
 * .
 * The logical links among the three applications are as follows:
 * - The Master Application sends commands to both Slave Applications
 * - Each Slave Application sends reports to the Master Application
 * .
 * Note that there is no logical link between the two slaves which are
 * completely independent of each other (see first figure below).
 *
 * The physical links among the three applications are as follows (see second figure
 * below):
 * - There is a socket-based link between the Master Application and Slave 1
 * - There is a socket-based link between the Slave 1 and Slave 2
 * .
 * Thus, messages between the Master Application and Slave 2 are routed through
 * Slave 1 (the routing is done by the CORDET Framework).
 *
 * The Master Application generates the commands to and receives the reports
 * from the Slave Applications.
