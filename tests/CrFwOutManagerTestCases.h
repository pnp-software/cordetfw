 * - The instance identifier and the type identifier of the OutManager is checked.
 * - It is checked that the POCL is empty and has the expected size.
 * - It is checked that the counter of loaded OutComponents is equal to zero.
 * - It is checked that the number and size of currently loaded OutComponents is zero.
 * - An attempt is made to create an OutManager with an illegal identifier and it is
 *   verified that this results in the application error code being set.
