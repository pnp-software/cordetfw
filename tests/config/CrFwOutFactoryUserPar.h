/**
 * Definition of the OutComponent kinds supported by an application.
 * An application supports a number of service types and, for each service type, it supports
 * a number of sub-types.
 * Each sub-type may support a range of discriminant values.
 * An OutComponent kind is defined by the triplet: [service type, service sub-type, discriminant].
 *
 * Each line in this initializer describes one OutComponent kind.
 * If the discriminant field is different from zero, then the line describes the characteristics
 * of the reports/commands of that specific kind (as identified by the triplet
 * [service type, service sub-type, discriminant]).
 * If, instead, the discriminant is equal to zero, then the line describes the default characteristics
 * of all reports/commands of the given type and sub-type.
 *
 * Thus, for instance, line 13 in the example below describes the default characteristics of
 * reports of type 5 and sub-type 4. According to the description at this line, reports of this
 * type/sub-type have a length of 50 bytes.
 * The following three lines describes reports of the same type/sub-type but with discriminants
 * equal to, respectively, 3, 5 and 7. These reports have characteristics which deviate from the
 * default defined at line 13 (for example, their length is, respectively, 100, 99 and 98
 * bytes instead of the default value of 50 defined at line 13).
 *
 * The elements in each line are as follows:
 * - The service type.
 * - The service sub-type.
 * - The discriminant value.
 * - The command/report flag. A value of 1 indicates that the OutComponent is a command and
 *   a value of 2 indicates that it is a report,
 * - The default length (in number of bytes) of the packet (see <code>CrFwPckt.h</code>) to which
 *   this kind of OutComponent is serialized.
 * - The function implementing the Enable Check Operation for this kind of component
 *   (this must be a function pointer of type <code>::CrFwOutCmpEnableCheck_t</code>;
 *   function <code>::CrFwOutCmpDefEnableCheck</code> can be used as default).
 * - The function implementing the Ready Check Operation for this kind of component
 *   (this must be a function pointer of type <code>::CrFwOutCmpReadyCheck_t</code>;
 *   function <code>::CrFwSmCheckAlwaysTrue</code> can be used as default).
 * - The function implementing the Repeat Check Operation for this kind of component
 *   (this must be a function pointer of type <code>::CrFwOutCmpRepeatCheck_t</code>;
 *   function <code>::CrFwSmCheckAlwaysFalse</code> can be used as default).
 * - The function implementing the Update Operation for this kind of component
 *   (this must be a function pointer of type <code>::CrFwOutCmpUpdate_t</code>;
 *   function <code>::CrFwSmEmptyAction</code> can be used as default).
 * - The function implementing the Serialize Operation for this kind of component
 *   (this must be a function pointer of type <code>::CrFwOutCmpSerialize_t</code>;
 *   function <code>CrFwOutCmpDefSerialize</code> can be used as default).
 * .
 * The list of service descriptors must satisfy the following constraints:
 * - The number of lines must be the same as <code>::CR_FW_OUTCMP_NKINDS</code>.
 * - The set of service types and sub-types and their discriminants must be consistent
 *   with the definition of <code>::CR_FW_OUTREGISTRY_INIT_SERV_DESC</code>.
 * - The service types must be listed in increasing order.
 * - The service sub-types within a service type must be listed in increasing order.
 * - The discriminant values within a service type/sub-type must be listed in increasing order.
 * - The packet length must be greater than zero.
 * - The packet length must be sufficiently large to ensure that all packet attributes can
 *   be stored in the packet.
 * .
 * Constraints 2 to 6 are checked by the auxiliary function
 * <code>::CrFwAuxOutFactoryConfigCheck</code>.
 *
 * The initializer values defined below are which are used for the framework Test Suite.
 * The function pointers in the last row are those of the Sample OutComponent defined in
 * <code>CrFwOutCmpSample1.h</code>.
