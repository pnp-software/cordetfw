/**
 * @file
 * @ingroup crOpenIfGroup
 * Interface for creating and accessing a report or command packet.
 * An application instantiated from the CORDET Framework interacts with other
 * framework applications by exchanging with them commands and reports.
 * When commands and reports travel from one application to another, they
 * take the form of packets.
 *
 * A packet is an ordered sequence of bytes which contain all the information
 * required to reconstruct a report or a command.
 * Although the exact layout of packets is not defined at framework level,
 * the framework defines, through this header file, an interface for creating and
 * accessing the data in a packet.
 *
 * This interface defines a packet factory, namely a function which allows
 * a new packet to be created and an existing packet to be released.
 *
 * A packet encapsulates either a command or a report.
 * This interface defines functions through which the attributes of the encapsulated
 * command or report can be retrieved from a packet or can be set in a packet.
 * For attributes other than the command or report parameters, getter and setter
 * functions are defined.
 * For the command or report parameters, getter functions are provided which return:
 * the start address of the parameter area of the packet and its size.
 * The parameter area is the part of a packet which is reserved to the storage
 * of the parameters of the command or report encapsulated by the packet.
 *
 * In general, the implementation of this interface is entirely application-specific
 * but a simple default implementation is provided in <code>CrFwPckt.c</code>.
 * This default implementation is primarily intended for testing and demonstration
 * purposes.

/**
 * Make function for command or report packets.
 * This function returns an unconfigured packet of the specified length.
 * An unconfigured packet of length L consists of a sequence of L bytes.
 * The function allocates the memory for the packet and returns a pointer to the
 * allocated memory.

 * The memory allocated to the packet remains reserved to the packet until the
 * packet is released through a call to function <code>::CrFwPcktRelease</code>.
 * The content of the packet returned by this function is undefined.
 * The way the memory is allocated and released is implementation-specific.
 *
 * If the allocation of the memory for the new packet failed, the function returns
 * NULL.
 * Depending on the implementation, allocation memory failure may result in
 * the application error code being set to <code>crPcktAllocationFail</code>.
 *
 * The packet length must be a positive integer.
 * If a negative or a zero value is used, the function returns NULL.
