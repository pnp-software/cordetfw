 * Definition of the InFactory component.
 *
 * The InFactory component offers an interface through which incoming report components
 * (InReports, see <code>CrFwInRep.h</code>) or incoming command components
 * (InCommands, see <code>CrFwInCmd.h</code> be allocated and released.
 *
 * The InFactory is implemented as an extension of the Base Component of
 * <code>CrFwBaseCmp.h</code>.
 * The InFactory is a singleton component.
 *
 * This interface provides a function to create the InFactory, it provides
 * functions to create an InReport or an InCommand of a specified kind,
 * and it provides functions to release previously allocated InReports or
 * InCommands.
 *
 * The InFactory maintains a pool of pre-allocated InReports and a pool
 * of pre-allocated InCommands
 * (the sizes of the pools are defined in <code>CrFwInFactoryUserPar.h</code>).
 * Memory for the pools is allocated when the InFactory is initialized and is only
 * released if the InFactory is shutdown.
 * Items in the pool are marked as "in use" when they are allocated to an application
 * and are marked as "not in use" when they are released.
 * No memory allocation operations (<code>malloc/free</code>) are therefore performed
 * when InReports or InCommands are allocated or released.
 * When the InFactory is reset, all the items in the pool are marked as "not in use".
 *
 * <b>Mode of Use of an InFactory Component</b>
 *
 * The configuration of the InFactory component is defined statically in
 * <code>CrFwInFactoryUserPar.h</code>.
 *
 * The InFactory is created with function <code>::CrFwInFactoryMake</code>.
 * After being created, the InFactory must be initialized and reset.
 * This is done with functions <code>::CrFwCmpInit</code> and <code>::CrFwCmpReset</code>.
 * Nominally, after being initialized and reset the InFactory State Machine should be
 * in state CONFIGURED (this can be checked by verifying that function <code>FwSmGetCurState</code>
 * returns CR_FW_BASE_STATE_CONFIGURED).
 *
 * After being configured, the InFactory is ready to manage the creation and release
 * process for InReports and InCommands.
 * An InReport is created with function <code>::CrFwInFactoryMakeInRep</code> and it
 * is released with function <code>::CrFwInFactoryReleaseInRep</code>.
 * Similarly, an InCommand is created with function <code>::CrFwInFactoryMakeInCmd</code> and it
 * is released with function <code>::CrFwInFactoryReleaseInCmd</code>.
 *
 * An InReport wraps a packet holding an incoming report and an InCommand wraps a packet
 * holding an incoming command.
 * The packet holding the report or command is passed as an argument to the make function which
 * creates the InReport or InCommand component.

 * This function initializes and resets a component before returning it.
 * Under nominal conditions, the component returned by this function is

 * if the InReport's configuration check fails).
 *
 * An InReport encapsulates an incoming packet holding a report.
 * The packet is passed as an argument to this function.
 * The packet holds all the information about the incoming report.
 * In particular, it holds the information about the report kind (as determined
 * by the triplet: [service type, service sub-type, discriminant]).
 * This function checks the report kind and its length:
 * - If the report kind is not defined in <code>CrFwInFactoryUserPar.h</code>, the
 *   function sets the application error code to <code>::crIllInRepKind</code> and
 *   returns NULL
 * - If an expected length is defined for the report kind, it is verified that the
 *   actual length of the report packet is the same as its expected length and, if
 *   this is not the case. the application error code is set to <code>::crIllInCmdLen</code> 
 *   and NULL is returned.
 * .
 * If the report kind and length are legal, this function configures the report
 * using configuration information from <code>CrFwInFactoryUserPar</code>.
 *
 * If the allocation of the memory for the new InReport fails, the function
 * returns NULL.
 * Allocation memory failure results in the application error code being set
 * to <code>crInRepAllocationFail</code>.
 *
 * When an InReport created by this function is no longer needed,
 * it should be returned to the factory by calling <code>CrFwInRepReleaseInRep</code>.
 *
 * The instance identifier of the InReport created by this function is equal to
 * the number of InReports created by the factory since it was last reset.
 *
 * If the InFactory is reset, then all the InReports which had been created
 * by the factory are released.

 * @param pckt the packet holding the InReport
 * @return a new InReport or NULL if it was not possible to allocate the memory
