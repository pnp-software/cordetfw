 * @brief Create one instance of the CrPsCmdVerSucc procedure
 *
 * This header file declares the function to create one instance of the CrPsCmdVerSucc procedure.
 * The procedure is configured with a set of function pointers representing the non-default
 * actions and guards of the procedure. Some of these functions may also be declared in
 * this header file in accordance with the configuration of the procedure in the FW Profile
 * Editor. In the latter case, the user has to provide an implementation for these functions
 * in a user-supplied body file.
 *
 * This header file has been automatically generated by the FW Profile Editor.
 * The procedure created by this file is shown in the figure below.
