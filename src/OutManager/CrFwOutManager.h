/**

 * @ingroup outMngGroup
 * Definition of the OutManager component.
 *
 * The OutManager component is responsible for maintaining a list of
 * pending OutComponents (see <code>CrFwOutCmp.h</code>) and for repeatedly
 * executing them until they are either aborted or else they are serialized
 * and sent to their destination.
 *
 * The list of pending commands is called the Pending OutComponent List or POCL.
 * The POCL has a fixed size which is defined statically in <code>CrFwOutManagerUserPar.h</code>.
 *
 * The OutManager is defined as an extension of the Base Component (see <code>CrFwBaseCmp.h</code>).
 * It uses the Execution Procedure of the Base Component to process the pending OutComponents.
 * The OutManager component processes the pending OutComponents by sending them an Execute command.
 * After each Execute command, the state of the OutComponent is reported to the OutRegistry
 * (see <code>CrFwOutRegistry.h</code>).
 * Commands which have been aborted or have been sent to their destination are removed
 * from the POCL and are returned to the OutFactory (see <code>CrFwOutFactory.h</code>).
 * The Execution Procedure of the OutManager is shown in the figure below.
 *
 * <b>Mode of Use of an OutManager Component</b>
 *
 * The configuration of the OutManager components is defined statically in
 * <code>CrFwOutManagerUserPar.h</code>.
 *
 * An OutManager component is created with function <code>::CrFwOutManagerMake</code>.
 * After being created, the OutManager must be initialized and reset.
 * This is done with functions <code>::CrFwCmpInit</code> and <code>::CrFwCmpReset</code>.
 * Nominally, after being initialized and reset the OutManager State Machine should be
 * in state CONFIGURED (this can be checked by verifying that function <code>FwSmGetCurState</code>
 * returns CR_FW_BASE_STATE_CONFIGURED).
 *
 * An application can have any number of OutManagers.
 *
 * An OutManager offers a Load operation (<code>::CrFwOutManagerLoad</code>) through which
 * an OutComponent can be added to the POCL.
 * This operation is normally called by the OutLoader (see <code>CrFwOutLoader.h</code>).
 *
 * There is no mechanism to “unload” a pending OutComponent.
 * The OutManager autonomously returns an OutComponent to the OutFactory when the
 * OutComponent has been sent to its destination (i.e. when the OutComponent is in
 * state TERMINATED) or when it has been aborted (i.e. when the OutComponent is in
 * state ABORTED).
 *
 * After an OutManager has been configured, it can be executed by means of function
 * <code>FwSmExecute</code>.
 * Execution of an OutManager causes its Execution Procedure (see figure below) to be
 * executed.
 *
 * When an OutManager is reset or shutdown, its POCL is reset (all pending OutComponents
 * are cleared and returned to the OutFactory).

/**
 * Load a new OutComponent into the OutManager.
 * The behaviour implemented by this function is shown in the activity diagram below.
 * If the POCL is not full, the function identifies a free position in the POCL where
 * to store the OutComponent.
 * If the POCL is full, the function generates the error report #crOutManagerPoclFull
 * and then releases the OutCompoment and returns.
 *
 * This function adds OutComponents to the POCL. The POCL is flushed when the OutManager
 * is executed (i.e. it is flushed by function <code>::OutManagerExecAction</code>).
 * The algorithms to identify a free position in the POCL and to process the POCL
 * entries when the OutManager is executed are optimized for a situation where multiple
 * load operations are performed before the OutManager is executed.
 *
 * Additionally, these algorithms guarantee the following ordering constraint.
 * Let OutComponents C1 to Cn be successfully loaded into an OutManager through a sequence
 * of calls to function <code>::CrFwOutManagerLoad</code> and assume that this sequence
 * of load operations is not interrupted by an execution of the OutManager.
 * Under these conditions, when the OutManager is executed next, the OutComponents C1 to
 * Cn will be processed in the order in which they have been loaded.
 *
 * The implementation of function <code>::CrFwOutManagerLoad</code> is based on the
 * internal variable <code>freePos</code>. This variable has the following
 * characteristics:
 * - it is initialized to point to the first entry in the POCL;
 * - after the execution of the load function, <code>freePos</code> either points to the next
 * free position in the POCL or is equal to the POCL size if the POCL is full;
 * - after execution of the OutManager, it is re-initialized to point to the first position
 * in the POCL.
 * .

 * @param outCmp the descriptor of the OutComponent to be loaded in the OutManager

 * the load operation has failed (the POCL was full and the OutComponent
